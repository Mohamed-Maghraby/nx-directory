 * Use auth.ts to configure authorization function like signIn, this auth is handled by next auth which make it easy to login/logout and 
 * do all auth.
 * ExL in singIn: we accept a user and a profile, then we check if it's an existed user or not based on it we we sign him up else we create 
 * a new author, also next-auth handles logout automatically.
 * Note we use sanity.write client to connect with sanity db which holds user's info.
 * Also we generate a JWT token based on user id, and a session.
